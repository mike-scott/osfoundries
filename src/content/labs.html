                            At Open Source Foundries, we are constantly creating software and new
                            technologies that help us deliver on our microPlatform mission.

                            These efforts, though they may not be formally supported as products, often help us
                            demonstrate the capabilities of our microPlatforms or help us
                            improve the overall ecosystems we participate in.

                            Our EZ containers project uses the <a class="link" href="https://portainer.io/">Portainer</a>
                            software project.  Portainer is "an open-source lightweight management UI which allows you to easily manage your docker hosts or swarm clusters".
                            <br><br>
                            In our EZ project we maintain an set of template containers
                            that can easily change the personality of a target system.  With
                            these templates you can turn your system into a
                            Google Assistant (with a microphone and speaker),
                            an Airplane Tracker (with an SDR radio),
                            a BLE IoT Gateway or load a variety of other demos.
