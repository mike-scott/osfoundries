Secure firmware over the air (FOTA) updates are a key [Zephyr microPlatform]({{< ref "product.md#zephyr-microplatform" >}}) feature. This post explains how to use your own firmware signing key pair to secure the boot process on your devices.

# Boot Process Overview

When your Zephyr microPlatform device boots, [MCUBoot](https://mcuboot.com/) checks for a cryptographically signed firmware update, then installs and runs it if one is available. Simplified, the boot process looks like this:

The firmware update signature check uses a public key stored in the MCUBoot binary running on the device. MCUBoot checks that the firmware update is signed by the corresponding private key before booting it. This mitigates against attacks which try to boot untrusted firmware on your device.

Think of the data being stored in your device's flash like this:

To make getting started easy, the MCUBoot repository's source code contains a default public key, along with its private key in a data file. Since the private key is not secret, this is not secure to use in production. When deploying your devices, you need to use your own key pair, with a private key that you must keep secret.

(If you're new to these ideas, check out the [Public-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) and [Digital signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) pages on Wikipedia.)

# Requirements

You must have the Zephyr microPlatform installed on your system.
Any board supported by the Zephyr microPlatform can be used with these instructions.

# Generate Keys

Run these commands from the Zephyr microPlatform installation directory.

MCUBoot provides tools which can create and manage your keys. This
section describes how to use them. For more details, including details on protecting your secret key with a password, see the file `mcuboot/docs/imgtool.md` in your Zephyr microPlatform installation directory.

The MCUBoot tools depend on the [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/) module. Install it first; for example, using `pip3`:

```
pip3 install --user cryptography
```

Now generate an RSA 2048 key pair (this is the default key type used by MCUBoot; if you configured MCUBoot differently, you need to adjust `-t` accordingly):

```
./mcuboot/scripts/imgtool.py keygen -k my-secret-key.pem -t rsa-2048
```

**The contents of the file my-secret-key.pem are a secret. Guard it closely.**

Next, generate some C code containing the public key as an array:

```
./mcuboot/scripts/imgtool.py getpub -k my-secret-key.pem
```

The output looks like this:

```c
/* Autogenerated by imgtool.py, do not edit. */
const unsigned char rsa_pub_key[] = {
	0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44, 0x55, 0x66, 0x77, 0x88,
	/* [additional lines omitted] */
	0x99, 0xaa, 0xbb, 0xcc, 0xdd, 0xee,
};
const unsigned int rsa_pub_key_len = 270;
```

You will copy these values into the MCUBoot source code.

# Copy the Public Key Into the MCUBoot Source Code

Now open the file `mcuboot/boot/zephyr/keys.c` in your editor. Search for lines that look like this:

```c
#if defined(MCUBOOT_SIGN_RSA)
const unsigned char root_pub_der[] = {
    0x30, 0x82, 0x01, 0x0a, 0x02, 0x82, 0x01, 0x01, 0x00, 0xd1, 0x06, 0x08,
    /* Additional lines omitted. */
    0xc9, 0x02, 0x03, 0x01, 0x00, 0x01
};
const unsigned int root_pub_der_len = 270;
}
```

Delete the elements of the `root_pub_der` array, and replace them with
the `imgtool.py` output, like this:

```c
#if defined(MCUBOOT_SIGN_RSA)
const unsigned char root_pub_der[] = {
	0x11, 0x22, 0x33, 0x44, 0x55, 0x66, 0x77, 0x88,
	/* [additional lines omitted] */
	0x99, 0xaa, 0xbb, 0xcc, 0xdd, 0xee,
};
const unsigned int root_pub_der_len = 270;
}
```

**Make sure to change the contents of `root_pub_der` only, not its name.**

**Make sure that the value of `root_pub_der_len` matches the `rsa_pub_key_len` generated by `imgtool`.**

Commit this change and ensure you preserve it.

# Build App With Custom MCUBoot image

You can now rebuild your Zephyr microPlatform application binary, along with a customized MCUBoot binary which trusts your public key. Here is an example building the `zephyr-fota-samples/dm-lwm2m` application for the `nrf52_blenano2` board using the `zmp` tool:

```
./zmp build -K my-secret-key.pem -b nrf52_blenano2 zephyr-fota-samples/dm-lwm2m
```

The important files this generates are:

- A custom MCUBoot binary which trusts your public key in `outdir/zephyr-fota-samples/dm-lwm2m/nrf52_blenano2/mcuboot/zephyr/zephyr.bin`. Use this binary when flashing devices you are going to deploy to the field.

- A Zephyr binary which is signed with your private key in `outdir/zephyr-fota-samples/dm-lwm2m/nrf52_blenano2/app/zephyr/dm-lwm2m-nrf52_blenano2-signed.bin`. You can distribute this binary in FOTA updates.

To verify your setup, flash the custom MCUBoot to your board, along with the signed binary into the main firmware image area. For example, using the `zmp` tool:

```
./zmp flash -b nrf52_blenano2 zephyr-fota-samples/dm-lwm2m
```
