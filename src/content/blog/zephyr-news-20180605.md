This is the 5 June 2018 newsletter tracking the latest
[Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org/) development merged into the
[mainline tree on
GitHub](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr).

<!--more-->

As usual, content is broken down as follows:

- **Highlights**
  - Important changes: ABI/API breaks and some features
  - New features: non-exhaustive descriptions of new features
  - Bug fixes: non-exhaustive list of fixed bugs
- **Individual changes**: a complete list of patches, sorted
  chronologically and categorized into areas, like:
  - Architectures
  - Kernel
  - Drivers
  - etc.

Highlights
==========

This covers what's happened since v1.12 rc1 was tagged, including
v1.12 rc2, which was tagged on 29 May, and changes since then.

Patch flow continues actively since rc1. This newsletter summarizes
the 409 patches in this inclusive range:

- [c182520e](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/c182520ee18b8826b8dcdd164de0263914ce12e6) tests: kernel: Add description for test cases
- [b5a3ddf7](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/b5a3ddf7d73e42ac9551f66414df82b7779cff2c) tests: ieee802154/crypto: use console harness

Since it's currently the stabilization period prior to the release of
Zephyr v1.12, the emphasis will be on tests, bug fixes, and
documentation, which are officially all that's currently permitted for
merge. (Of course, late-breaking exceptions manage to wiggle through.)

The final release is blocked until there are zero high priority and
less than twenty medium priority bugs.

Zephyr's wiki has links to helpful [filters showing the number of open
bugs](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/wiki/Filters) and
other issues of various types. At time of writing, there are **4 high
priority bugs** and **30 medium priority bugs** open, so there's still
work to do before v1.12 is fully baked.

Important Changes
-----------------

**Schedule\(r) wrangling:**

The following appeared in the previous newsletter: "In a highly
significant but (hopefully mostly) behind-the-scenes change, the
scheduler was rewritten." Hope springs eternal.

As may have been expected, rewrites of central and notoriously
tricky areas like kernel schedulers inevitably result in bugs which
need shaking out. Most noticeably, boot hangs and increasingly lengthy
context switch times have been observed in a variety of circumstances,
and some significant bug fixes have been flowing in following the
rewrite, notably affecting pre-emption, scheduling of dummy threads,
and SMP scheduling.

The dust appears to be settling for v1.12, but more changes are in the
works for v1.13. Hold on to your hats.

**CONFIG_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT removed:**

This legacy Kconfig option is gone now. Any remaining users must
switch to the ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT CMake or environment variable,
as documented in the [Getting
Started](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/getting_started/getting_started.html)
guide.

**Kconfig cleanup:**

In a valiant tree-wide cleanup effort, a number of stale or incorrect
Kconfig symbols were updated and fixed. This affected essentially
every subsystem. Merge conflicts for out-of-tree patches seem likely.

**zephyr_library_ifdef() removed:**

The build system's `zephyr_library_ifdef()` macro was that evil type
which modifies the control flow of the caller. In-tree uses were
replaced with safer alternatives and the macro was removed; any out of
tree users will need updates.

Features
--------

**Architectures:**

Nordic SoCs have their instruction cache enabled. Users who don't want
their code to run faster can disable the new
`CONFIG_NRF_ENABLE_ICACHE`, which is on by default.

Precious, precious MPU regions were freed up on various ARM SoCs by
deleting existing entries for memory-mapped peripheral buses and other
such areas in SoC configuration files. Access privileges for these
areas are now determined by the special "background region", or
default configuration, which allows RWX access for supervisor mode,
and prevents user mode access. This frees up these scarce resources
for use defining restrictions on other areas of memory, such as thread
stacks.

**Boards:**

Support was added for the NUCLEO-L053R8 board, which features an
STM32L053R8 SoC.

**Drivers:**

Some new features were added here, in some cases to enable bug fixes,
and in others as late-breaking exceptions to the freeze.

In order to address issues with entropy gathering, a new
interrupt-safe source of entropy, `entropy_get_entropy_isr()`, was
added to the API in include/entropy.h. An implementation is provided
for nRF devices. This was aided by other initialization order changes
which collectively allow the kernel to safely collect entropy earlier
in its initialization.

Users of the w25qxxdv SPI flash driver have new Kconfig options
allowing them to control chip select pins, which can be enabled and
set using `CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_W25QXXDV_GPIO_SPI_CS`.

A new `status_cb` field was added to `struct netusb_function`,
allowing such functions to define status callbacks. This new API was
needed to fix some issues causing kernel crashes.

Driver support was added for STM32 low power UARTs (LPUARTs); this can
be enabled with `CONFIG_UART_STM32_LPUART_1`.

**Kernel:**

A new "meta-IRQ" feature was added to control scheduling for a new
type of thread. A meta-IRQ is not a true interrupt, but pending
threads with meta-IRQ priority will be scheduled before any other
threads, **even cooperative ones or those which have the scheduler
lock**. This has the flavor of the "softirq" mechanism present in the
Linux kernel, and appears to have similar goals. Like softirqs, these
must be used with care, and are likely not good targets for application
developer use. See the [Meta-IRQ
Priorities](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/kernel/threads/scheduling.html#meta-irq-priorities)
section in the threads documentation for more details on their design
and goals.

A patch was merged which enables ongoing work producing a requirements
traceability matrix from requirements to test cases in APIs exposed by
the main include/kernel.h. This adds Doxygen comments with requirement
IDs to individual APIs, so it's technically documentation.

A simple deadline scheduling policy was implemented. See
`CONFIG_SCHED_DEADLINE` for details.

**Scripts:**

The Python menuconfig implementation has new features for showing a
symbol's name when 'c' is pressed, along with improvements to
searching, saving, and loading.

Kconfiglib now warns if a string symbol's default value is not quoted.

Bug Fixes
---------

**Arches:**

The majority of the fixes applied to the x86 and ARM architectures.
These cover typos and coding style, scheduling, stack management, IRQ
management, scheduling, and MPU management, as well as SoC
specific fixes mostly targeting STM32 and x86 chips.

Optional mitigation was added for Spectre variant v4 on Intel chips;
see `CONFIG_DISABLE_SSBD` for details.

**Bluetooth:**

It was quiet, but not too quiet.

Beyond the Kconfig cleanup, a small number of fixes were merged,
including a compiler-version specific fix for Mesh and a fix for
non-priority event handling in the core controller code. The Bluetooth
subsystem is one of Zephyr's best tested, and the small size of the
change list in this period reflects this.

**Boards:**

Beyond the tree-wide Kconfig fixes, a general fix was merged for "make
flash" for boards using the "bossac" flashing tool. A variety of
patches were merged fixing board-specific issues and enabling some
missing features. See the Boards list of commits in the Individual
Changes section below to learn if boards you use were affected.

**Continuous Integration:**

An arguable misconfiguration in sanitycheck related to job parallelism
was addressed, resulting in a 24% speed improvement. Other
miscellaneous fixes to sanitycheck were merged as well.

External libraries are no longer tracked in code coverage
measurements, improving the accuracy of the code coverage output for
Zephyr-specific code.

**Device Tree:**

A variety of fixes went in for warnings generated by the new dtc
v1.4.6 compiler which was part of the new Zephyr 0.9.3 SDK, with a
handful of fixes in other areas.

**Documentation:**

The effort preparing the documentation for release is picking up steam.

Missing documentation was added covering system calls and userspace,
kernel and threading APIs, POSIX compatibility, VLANs, network traffic
classification, the sanitycheck script used by CI, and more.

Numerous spelling errors were corrected in a series of commits, each
targeting specific areas.

**Drivers:**

About fifteen percent of the total patches in this period affected
Zephyr's device drivers.

Apart from the Kconfig cleanup, STM32-specific driver fixes featured
prominently, affecting SPI, UART, Ethernet, and GPIO. Fixes for
drivers needed by the new intel_s1000_crb board were merged affecting
I2S and DMA.

**External:**

The build system integration for OpenAMP and libmetal was fixed to
avoid recursive builds, which the Zephyr build system (maintainer)
abhors. May other developers tempted down that dark way be warned, and
stay along the straight path.

mbedTLS was updated to version 2.9.0 from 2.8.0; this brings
security fixes along with other improvements.

A subtle power-related USB fix for STM32 was merged, adding a patch to
Zephyr's copy of the STM32L4 HAL.

**Kernel:**

Various fixes were merged apart from the scheduler rodeo. It looks
like the dust is settling on these issues for v1.12, but the opening
of the v1.13 merge window will include additional refactoring of the
scheduler to better consolidate flags associated with non-running
threads, so the list of incoming scheduler changes won't be empty
anytime soon.

A race was fixed in the mempool allocator. Some architecture-specific
fixes were made that the meta-IRQ addition exposed. The kernel now
uses the new ISR-safe entropy source during early initialization,
before threads are available, and uses the entropy API directly to
initialize stack canaries.

**Libraries:**

A bug making the `clock_gettime()` implementation non-monotonic when
called with CLOCK_MONOTONIC was fixed.

**Networking:**

Not much was merged; the networking developers are hard at
work with the ongoing rewrite of Zephyr's TLS implementation to use a
new and nonstandard setsockopt()-based API. Since that's feature work,
it will have to wait for v1.13 to be merged.

Fixes went in around the subsystem addressing problems where incorrect
timeouts were set due to use of `MSEC()` or raw numbers instead of
`K_MSEC()`, and other related issues.

A boot hang related to invalid use of a receive queue was fixed.

A security session initialization bug affecting 802.15.4 was fixed.

Most of the other fixes appear to be of the usual variety: a null
pointer dereference, packet management and checksumming issues, edge
cases and error handling, etc.

**Samples:**

Other than the Kconfig cleanup, the samples didn't seem to need too
many changes since rc1, which is good.

The coap_server sample properly handles the case where the client no
longer wishes to receive notifications following an initial observe
operation. The coap_client application also saw general improvements
and fixes.

The OpenAMP sample has improved documentation and comments.

**Scripts:**

Not much happened here.

The elf_helper.py library used by the build system to manipulate
Zephyr binaries got some cleanup and an architecture-specific corner
case fix.

Issues in west preventing "make flash" etc. from working on certain
boards, as well as running as root on Unix, were fixed.

Fixes were made to genrest.py, which generates Zephyr's Kconfig symbol
documentation.

**Storage:**

This subsystem was fairly quiet as well.

As might be expected with new code, a variety of bug fixes went in to
the non-volatile storage (NVS) layer. These are mostly related to
buffer management and padding, and also include a fix related to
device addressing.

A pile of issues in the disk subsystem discovered by Coverity were
fixed with extra NULL pointer checks.

**Testing:**

Test, test, one, two, three, ... eighty commits have gone in to
improving Zephyr's tests. These break down into the following rough
categories:

- tons of test descriptions added as Doxygen comments (see [issue
  #6991](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/6991) for
  details on how this is part of a larger strategy)
- other restructuring and refactoring to make #6991 infrastructure work better
- fixes to problems in the sources for the test case themselves
- fixes and improvements related to testing user mode
- Kconfig cleanup
- new tests

As always, details are below.
