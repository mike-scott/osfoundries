In this blog we describe how to use the Zephyr microPlatform and the in-tree Zephyr samples to perform an Over-The-Air (OTA) of Zephyr over BLE.  This demonstration uses the DFU support within Zephyr and the mcumgr framework.

# Overview

Before getting started, some of the features described in this blog requires accessing features released to subscribers of the Zephyr microPlatform.  You can find out more about subscriptions at: [https://foundries.io](https://foundries.io).

In this blog, we will prepare system to use the Zephyr microPlatform; deploy our initial code to the device, and then deploy new code to the device using OTA updates.

## Install the Zephyr microPlatform:

   Please refer to our documentation to install the Zephyr microPlatform at: [https://foundries.io/mp/zmp/latest/docs/tutorial/installation-zephyr.html](https://foundries.io/mp/zmp/latest/docs/tutorial/installation-zephyr.html)

   __NOTE:__ in this blog, we use the nRF52840-DK board instead of the BLE Nano 2
   used by default in the documentation. To use the nRF52840-DK, the following
   changes are needed:

   - Use "-b nrf52840_pca10056" instead of "-b nrf52_blenano2" when
     running ZMP

   - The vendor-specific flashing tools needed are the nRF5x command
     line tools, not PyOCD. Get the command line tools from here

     You can download the nRF5x tools from:
     [http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.tools%2Fdita%2Ftools%2Fnrf5x_command_line_tools%2Fnrf5x_nrfjprogexe.html](http://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.nordic.infocenter.tools%2Fdita%2Ftools%2Fnrf5x_command_line_tools%2Fnrf5x_nrfjprogexe.html)

## Install mcmgr application on your dev machine

  Install the mcumgr application using "go get" (requires Go 1.7 or later):

     $ go get github.com/apache/mynewt-mcumgr-cli/mcumgr

   Make sure ~/go/bin is on the PATH of the user that runs the
   "mcumgr" commands.

## Build and flash the smp_srv application

   With your device console connected (115200 baud, 8N1), build and
   flash the smp_svr application, which allows DFU firmware update via
   BLE:


     $ ./zmp build -b nrf52840_pca10056 zephyr/samples/subsys/mgmt/mcumgr/smp_svr/
     $ ./zmp flash -b nrf52840_pca10056 zephyr/samples/subsys/mgmt/mcumgr/smp_svr/

   If the flash step fails, make sure your NRF52840-DK is connected
   via USB. One way to check is to make sure running "nrfjprog --ids"
   lists the board's ID.

   The console output should look like this:

## Manage the device using mcumgr

In this section you will connect, update and query the device using mcumgr.

__Connect to the device using mcumgr__

   It's now time to connect to your device using mcumgr.

   These commands generally have to be run as root (commands are
   prefixed with `#` instead of `$`), so first make sure mcumgr is
   in root's PATH.

     $ sudo -s
     # export PATH=$PATH:/home/YOUR_USERNAME/go/bin

     # mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring ctlr_name=hci0,peer_name='Zephyr' echo hello
     hello

   If that doesn't work, make sure a 'Zephyr' device shows up in your
   'hcitool lescan' output and try again.

   If you get errors like "Error: NMP timeout" when running mcumgr,
   reset your device and try again using nrfjprog:

     $ nrfjprog --reset

__Verify that only one application image is installed.__

    # mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring ctlr_name=hci0,peer_name='Zephyr' image list
    Images:
    slot=0
       version: 0.0.0
       bootable: true
       flags: active confirmed
       hash: c7567dd9b84d15ddb4345e38435822ef102f5d1683e8425d5447bafd5cb15c11

__Modify the sample application and update it OTA__

   Edit the file
   zephyr/samples/subsys/mgmt/mcumgr/smp_svr/src/main.c,
   adding a printline to the main() function:

    printk("This application has been updated\n");

   Now re-build it with a different version number using zmp (make
   sure to do this from a non-root shell):

    $ ./zmp build -b nrf52840_pca10056 --imgtool-version 0.1.0 zephyr/samples/subsys/mgmt/mcumgr/smp_svr

   From the root shell, upload the modified image to your device:

    # mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring ctlr_name=hci0,peer_name='Zephyr' image upload outdir/zephyr/samples/subsys/mgmt/mcumgr/smp_svr/nrf52840_pca10056/app/zephyr/smp_svr-nrf52840_pca10056-signed.bin

__Query the device and make sure 0.1.0 is visible:__

    # mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring ctlr_name=hci0,peer_name='Zephyr' image list
    Images:
    slot=0
       version: 0.0.0
       bootable: true
       flags: active confirmed
       hash: c7567dd9b84d15ddb4345e38435822ef102f5d1683e8425d5447bafd5cb15c11
    slot=1
       version: 0.1.0
       bootable: true
       flags:
       hash: 7806e0a1239aa772f3c1c9ea121c8c95d485fc38b2b3bb930275b63a7962f938
    Split status: N/A (0)

   Note the presence of an update image in slot 1 with updated image
   version.

__Confirm the update__

   "Confirm" the slot 1 image by SHA. This will make the bootloader
   MCUboot install it during the next boot. From the above example,

    # mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring ctlr_name=hci0,peer_name='Zephyr' image test 7806e0a1239aa772f3c1c9ea121c8c95d485fc38b2b3bb930275b63a7962f938
    Images:
    slot=0
       version: 0.0.0
       bootable: true
       flags: active confirmed
       hash: c7567dd9b84d15ddb4345e38435822ef102f5d1683e8425d5447bafd5cb15c11
    slot=1
       version: 0.1.0
       bootable: true
       flags: pending
       hash: 7806e0a1239aa772f3c1c9ea121c8c95d485fc38b2b3bb930275b63a7962f938
    Split status: N/A (0)

   Note how the "flags" field now says "pending". This means the
   update image will be used at the next device reset.

__Reboot the device using DFU:__

    # mcumgr --conntype ble --connstring ctlr_name=hci0,peer_name='Zephyr' reset

   You will see bootloader output confirming MCUboot is swapping into
   the new image, then see the new printline with the string "This
   application has been updated":

     ***** Booting Zephyr OS v1.1.0-52-g5bac42f *****
     [MCUBOOT] [INF] main: Starting bootloader
     [MCUBOOT] [INF] boot_status_source: Image 0: magic=unset, copy_done=0xff, image_ok=0xff
     [MCUBOOT] [INF] boot_status_source: Scratch: magic=unset, copy_done=0x0, image_ok=0xff
     [MCUBOOT] [INF] boot_status_source: Boot source: slot 0
     [MCUBOOT] [INF] boot_swap_type: Swap type: test
     [MCUBOOT] [INF] main: Bootloader chainload address offset: 0xc000
     [MCUBOOT] [INF] main: Jumping to the first image slot
     ***** Booting Zephyr OS v1.11.0-633-g973b01a68 *****

     Type 'help' for a list of available commands
     shell> This application has been updated
     Bluetooth initialized
     Advertising successfully started

   Since the updated application also supports the mcumgr protocol,
   you can make additional changes and update it with a third version
   using the above steps.
