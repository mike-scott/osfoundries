Highlights
==========

This newsletter covers changes in Zephyr between these two
commits (inclusive):

- [e15a4923](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/e15a4923e88d038845457201fe11698ad0bb267e) ci: Clean the capability cache when the ccache is cleaned
- [e7509c17](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/e7509c17c5938b48f9ad4b7ae78199bb0faa6113) release: Move version to 1.12.0-rc1

Development since the last newsletter has been active, with 300+
patches merged before last Friday's release feature freeze and
subsequent tagging of v1.12.0-rc1. (If you're unfamiliar with Zephyr's
release process, see the
[Development-Model](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/wiki/Development-Model)
page on the wiki for more details on these terms.)

The v1.12 release was originally the candidate for the first Long-Term
Support release. However, the release of the first LTS has been
postponed for various reasons, including ongoing work in:

- [architectural updates to the networking stack](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/7591)
- [device driver API stabilization](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/5697)
- [moving all boards to use Device tree](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/4960)

Along with other issues tracked using the [LTS label in Zephyr's
GitHub
issues](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/labels/LTS).

An online meeting is being scheduled for further revisiting and
discussing what is required for the final LTS release; details are
expected to be released in the next day or two.

Some timelines are already available; for example, the networking
architectural updates, which are tracked in [issue
7591](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/7591), are
targeting completion of major new features in v1.14:

presentation given to Zephyr's Technical Steering Committee by Andrei
Laperie of Intel).

Important Changes
-----------------

**OpenAMP**:

OpenAMP (and its libmetal dependency) was merged to enable
message-based cross-core communication. This carries BSD-3-Clause and
BSD-2-Clause licenses.

An usage sample is in [samples/subsys/openamp](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/samples/subsys/ipc/openamp/README.html).

**New Zephyr SDK**:

Zephyr SDK version 0.9.3 has been released. Linux users should upgrade
using the updated [installation
instructions](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/getting_started/installation_linux.html).

**Non-volatile Storage (NVS)**:

A long-running pull request to add a new storage mechanism for
persistent data was merged. The new Non-Volatile Storage (NVS)
subsystem is meant as an alternative to the existing FAT and NFFS file
systems, as well as the Flash Circular Buffer (FCB) library which was
ported to Zephyr from the MyNewt RTOS.

For more details, refer to the [NVS subsystem
documentation](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/subsystems/nvs/nvs.html).

This would seem to pair well with the [storage API
changes](/blog/2018/05/14/zephyr-news-20180514/) discussed in the
previous newsletter which introduced greater abstraction over the
storage backend.

**k_call_stacks_analyze() deprecated**:

The k_call_stacks_analyze() API was deprecated. Users are recommended
to switch to using
[k_thread_foreach()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv216k_thread_foreach18k_thread_user_cb_tPv),
perhaps re-implementing or calling into a stack usage dumping routine
for each thread.

**Userspace changes**:

Numerous userspace-related features and optimizations were merged.

New API was merged for memory management from specified memory
pools. The main functions are
[k_mem_pool_malloc()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv217k_mem_pool_mallocP10k_mem_pool6size_t)
and
[k_mem_pool_free()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv215k_mem_pool_freeP11k_mem_block).
This is used to allow dynamic allocation of
kernel objects from userspace.

Cleanup functions defined on a per-kernel-object-type basis can now
be invoked when an object loses all permissions. This is used as a
framework for automatic resource release for dynamically-allocated
userspace objects.

New APIs were added for userspace allocation and freeing of kernel
objects of various types:

- [k_pipe_alloc_init()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv217k_pipe_alloc_initP6k_pipe6size_t)/[k_pipe_cleanup()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv214k_pipe_cleanupP6k_pipe) for pipes
- [k_msgq_alloc_init()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv217k_msgq_alloc_initP6k_msgq6size_t5u32_t)/[k_msgq_cleanup()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv214k_msgq_cleanupP6k_msgq) for message queues
- [k_stack_alloc_init()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv218k_stack_alloc_initP7k_stackj)/[k_stack_cleanup()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv215k_stack_cleanupP7k_stack) for stack objects

Additional APIs for allowing userspace access to queues includes:

- [k_queue_alloc_append()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv220k_queue_alloc_appendP7k_queuePv)/[k_queue_alloc_prepend](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv221k_queue_alloc_prependP7k_queuePv)
- [k_fifo_alloc_put()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#c.k_fifo_alloc_put)
- [k_lifo_alloc_put()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#c.k_lifo_alloc_put)

The [k_poll Polling
API](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/kernel/other/polling.html) is now
also accessible from user mode.

An optimization was merged which avoids executing user/supervisor
boundary checks when invoking system calls from privileged code in
translation units defined under arch/.

Access to the k_object_access_revoke() routine from userspace was
itself revoked, closing a hole where one thread could inappropriately
revoke another's access to a kernel object. Userspace threads may
revoke access to their own objects with k_object_release().

**TCP TIME_WAIT config changes**:

Configuration for how long Zephyr's TCP stack remains in the TIME_WAIT
state during connection closure is now managed through the single
[CONFIG_NET_TCP_TIME_WAIT_DELAY](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/reference/kconfig/CONFIG_NET_TCP_TIME_WAIT_DELAY.html)
option. This replaces the previous CONFIG_NET_TCP_TIME_WAIT and
CONFIG_NET_TCP_2MSL_TIME options. Applications using the old options
will need updates.

Features
--------

**Architectures**:

Support for Arm's v8-M cores continues, with support for secure fault
handling on Cortex-M23 along with other behind-the-scenes work on
memory access privilege checks.

There is a new CONFIG_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_INIT available on Arm
targets. When enabled, the user must provide a `_PlatformInit`
routine, which will be called at Zephyr startup before anything else
happens.

Support was added to enable a Zephyr image running on an NXP LPC-based
SoC to boot a slave Cortex M0+ core. (Board support was added for the
slave core as `lpcxpresso54114_m0`.)

**Bluetooth**:

The Mesh shell now supports the recently-merged persistent storage
mechanism.

**Device Tree and Drivers**:

Zephyr now supports the automobile Controller Area Network (CAN)
protocol. The API is specified in include/can.h. The new API is
userspace-aware.

GPIO bindings were added for QMSI (Intel Quark) based devices, with
nodes added for quark_se_c1000_ss.

Device tree bindings were added for real-time clocks (RTCs), as well
as NXP Kinetis and QMSI based RTCs. SoC support was added for
KW41Z and quark_se_c1000_ss.

Additional patches continuing the work migrating LED and buttons
definitions to device tree were merged for mimxrt1050_evk and
lpcxpresso54114. Device tree support for sensors on the argonkey board
was also merged, along with em_starterkit device tree optimizations,
and bindings for LSM6DSL sensors and Kinetis watchdogs. A shim driver
using the newly-stabilized watchdog API was added for NXP MCUx
devices. SOC support is provided for K64 and KW2XD.

USBD (USB device) and USBFSOTG (USB full-speed On-the-Go) support was
added for NXP Kinetis SoCs. USB support was also enabled for STMicro
nucleo_f413zh.

WiFi support for the WINC1500 network controller was merged. This chip
can be used to add networking via SPI. This is the first user of the
new WiFi API which was merged during the v1.12 development
cycle. Support can be enabled using CONFIG_WIFI_WINC1500.

A driver was added for ILI9340 LCD displays.

**External Libraries**:

The OpenThread library version was bumped to db4759cc, to pull in some
bug fixes.

The Atmel WINC1500 WiFi driver was merged as part of enabling WiFI on
that chip. This is a BSD-3-Clause licensed HAL.

**Kernel**:

In a highly significant but (hopefully mostly) behind-the-scenes change,
[the scheduler was rewritten](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/1acd8c2996c3a1ae0691247deff8c32519307f17).

A new [k_thread_foreach()](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/api/kernel_api.html#_CPPv216k_thread_foreach18k_thread_user_cb_tPv)
API was merged, which allows iterating over
threads. This requires CONFIG_THREAD_MONITOR to be enabled. Creation
and termination of existing threads is blocked via irq_lock() while
the routine is executing.

**Libraries**:

The red-black tree implementation in include/misc/rb.h now has
RB_FOR_EACH() and RB_FOR_EACH_CONTAINER() macros, for iterating over
red-black tree nodes and the structs which contain them.

The POSIX compatibility layer has additional file system support
APIs. Pulling in the POSIX headers defines macros which map POSIX
names to Zephyr-specific file system APIs appropriately. This includes
support for basic syscalls such as open(), read(), write(), close(),
and friends, and also allows for directory operations such as
rename(), stat(), and mkdir(). Refer to the headers in include/posix
for more information.

There is also now support for the POSIX mutex APIs.

**Miscellaneous**:

A new API was added for a singly-linked-list like type which allows
storing two flags in each node, by relying on 4-byte pointer
aligment. For details, refer to include/misc/sflist.h.

**Networking**:

The LWM2M subsystem now includes support for marking resources as
optional. Any resources so marked are not initialized by the core
LWM2M subsystem; applications must initialize them using
lwm2m_engine_set_res_data() and lwm2m_engine_get_res_data().  This
also enables remote administration of these resources by the LWM2M
server through CREATE operations. It also enables future work where
BOOTSTRAP operations will behave differently when encountering
optional resources. As part of these changes, various object resources
throughout the LWM2M core and in supported IPSO objects were marked
optional appropriately.

The 802.15.4 subsystem now supports source address filtering and
performing energy detection scans when OpenThread is in use.

**Samples**:

New samples include:

- a RPL border router application, [samples/net/rpl_border_router](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/samples/net/rpl_border_router/README.html)
- A WiFi shell sample, [samples/net/wifi](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/samples/net/wifi/README.html)
- An OpenAMP usage sample, [samples/subsys/openamp](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/samples/subsys/ipc/openamp/README.html)
- An MCUX IPM mailbox example, [samples/subsys/ipc/ipm_mcux](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/samples/subsys/ipc/ipm_mcux/README.html)
- A sample for the 96Boards ArgonKey, [samples/boards/96b_argonkey](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/samples/boards/96b_argonkey/README.html)
- A CAN sample, [samples/can](http://docs.zephyrproject.org/samples/can/README.html), tested on stm32f072b_disco

**Scripts**:

The flash, debug, and debugserver handlers now use a new meta-tool
called "west". This is still a behind-the-scenes change; further work
expected before the v1.12 release will add documentation for this
tool.

**Testing**:

The effort adding descriptions, cleanups, and other improvements to
Zephyr's test cases to use them from a higher-level test management
system continues.

Bug Fixes
---------

Numerous drivers cleanups and bug fixes went in, affecting various
devices.

Various Arm-specific fixes went in as part of the v8-M work.

A new CONFIG_BT_MES_IVU_DIVIDER went in, which fixes an issue related
to re-initializing initialization vectors. Various other Bluetooth
cleanups and fixes went in, including removals of deprecated APIs and
unused variables and documentation fixes.

Numerous fixes and additional Doxygen descriptions went into the test
cases.

Networking fixes include net-app fixes for TLS warnings, source IPv4
address selection, build fixes with TCP disabled, and byte order
handling; ethernet MAC address setting; LWM2M port handling fixes;
dropping of invalid packets; and a couple of ICMPv6 fixes.

Various build fixes, error handling and Kconfig dependency management
improvements, k_call_stacks_analyze() removals, and more were added to
the samples.
